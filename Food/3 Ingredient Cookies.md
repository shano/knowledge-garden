### Instructions
* Preheat the oven to 175C/350F. Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
* In a large mixing bowl, add all ingredients and mix very well, until fully combined. If using chocolate chips, stir them in with a spatula.
* Lightly wet your hands and form 8 balls with the cookies. Place each ball on the lined mat, and press each ball into a cookie shape. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until slightly golden on the edges. Remove from the oven. 
* Allow cooling on the mat for 10 minutes, before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. 
* Refrigerate and keep for up to 5 days or freeze for up to two months.
