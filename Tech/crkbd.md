My primary keyboard is a [Corne Keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) with [Helidox Key Caps](https://mechboards.co.uk/products/helidox-corne-kit).

- The [miryoku layout](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) looks like something worth trying. I'm finding the default layout really problematic.
