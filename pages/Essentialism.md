- Philosophy: "Less but better," focus on doing the right things, making execution effortless, living a life true to oneself, and pursuing discipline over undisciplined reduction.
- Planning: Spend 20 minutes reading, invest in reflection, avoid unproductive meetings, prioritize the most important things, and schedule blank space for thinking.
- During the day: Ask if what you're doing is the most important, keep a journal, prioritize tasks, set boundaries, and take 15 seconds to write down objectives before each meeting.
- End of the day: Brain dump to sleep peacefully.
- Monthly: Read the journal to find leads.
- Success: Reduce choices, make a conscious effort to keep what's important organized, and create a system to remove obstacles and make execution easy. Play is essential, define criteria for evaluating opportunities, start small and celebrate progress, design a routine and maintain consistency.
- Buffers: Plan ahead, add 50% to all estimates, consider risks and social and 
  financial impact, and reduce them.
- Discern what matters: Space to think, time to look and listen, permission to play, wisdom to sleep, 
  discipline to apply selective criteria, and avoid the latest trends.
- What matters: Follow what inspires you, what you're talented at, what 
  meets a significant need, and celebrate relationships with loved ones.
- Leadership: Clarity in goals, define essential intent, focus on removing constraints and obstacles, avoid hyped up projects, and reward progress.
- Saying no: Say "no" clearly, prioritize tasks, and enable  others to solve problems.
- In the immediate: Reintroduce childhood activities, eliminate time-wasting tasks, and prioritize self-care.
