- Philosophy
	- Less but better
	- Get the right things gone
	- Stop saying yes and make your highest contribution towards things that really matter.
	- Make execution effortless
	- Live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me
	- Disciplined pursuit of less not undisciplined pursuit of less.
	- Don't learn to be helpless, a function of other peoples desires.
- During the day
	- Ask yourself frequently "Is this the most important thing I could be doing right now?'
- Planning your day
	- Stop attending meetings you can't contribute to or can't get anything from
	- Tell yourself
		- I choose to
		- Only a few things matter
		- I can do anything not everything
- Set yourself up for success
	- Reduce your choices, and protect your ability to evaluate the importance of things. "Design fatigue" is a thing.
	- Make a conscious effort to keep what's important organised.
		- Notice if you've given up your power to choose bit by bit.
		- Note if you're powerless yet hyperactive.
		- Never ignore the reality of trade offs.
	- Create a system to remove obstacles and make execution as easy as possible.
- What matters?
	- What do I feel deeply inspired by?
	- What am I particularly talented at?
	- What meets a significant need in the world?
	- Celebrate listening, pondering, meditating and enjoying time with the most important people in our lives.
