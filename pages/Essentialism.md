- Philosophy
	- Less but better
	- Get the right things gone
	- Stop saying yes and make your highest contribution towards things that really matter.
	- Make execution effortless
	- Live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me
	- Disciplined pursuit of less not undisciplined pursuit of less.
	- Don't learn to be helpless, a function of other peoples desires.
- Planning your day
	- Spend 20 minutes reading something timeless.
	- Invest in space to reflect
	- Stop attending meetings you can't contribute to or can't get anything from
	- Tell yourself
		- I choose to
		- Only a few things matter
		- I can do anything not everything
		- What do I want to go big on?
	- What problem do I want?
	- Schedule blank space to think.
	- Don't fill your day! Budget your time with all bets are off.
	- Minimum viable progress.
- During the day
	- Ask yourself frequently "Is this the most important thing I could be doing right now?'
	- Keep a "less but better" journal
	- If the answer isn't a definite yes, it's a no. What's the most important criterion for the decision, if it's less than 90% reject it.
	- Don't do because others ask.
	- Wait, observe, see how things develop.
	- Set boundaries, capture "dealbreakers" when you feel put upon by someones request.
- Monthly
	- Read your "less but better" journal, find the lead!
- Set yourself up for success
	- Reduce your choices, and protect your ability to evaluate the importance of things. "Design fatigue" is a thing.
	- Make a conscious effort to keep what's important organised.
		- Notice if you've given up your power to choose bit by bit.
		- Note if you're powerless yet hyperactive.
		- Never ignore the reality of trade offs, avoid the straggled strategy.
	- Create a system to remove obstacles and make execution as easy as possible.
	- Restore play in your life, it's essential.

	- Systems to keep things neat, don't let them build up.
	- Find your slowest hiker, the thing that holds you up the most.
	- Start small, celebrate progress.
- Buffers
	- Capture all the big projects ahead of time, spend time upfront planning accordingly.
	- Add 50 percent to all estimates
	- What risk do we face on this project?
	- What's is the worst case scenario?
	- What would the social effect of this be?
	- What would the financial impact of this be?
	- How can you invest to reduce risks or strengthen financial or social resilience?
- Discern what's truly essential
	- Space to think
	- Time to look and listen
	- Permission to play
	- Wisdom to sleep
	- Discipline to apply highly selective criteria to the choices we make
	- Avoid the latest thing, create the space to explore and ponder
- What matters?
	- What do I feel deeply inspired by?
	- What am I particularly talented at?
	- What meets a significant need in the world?
	- Celebrate listening, pondering, meditating and enjoying time with the most important people in our lives.
- Leadership
	- Lack of clarity in goals kills motivation. Leads to confusion, stress and frustration.
	- Find out your highest level of contribution. Define your essential intent. Inspirational, concrete, meaningful and measurable.
	- "If we could be truly excellent at one thing what would it be?"
	- Too many even good activities don't add up to a meaningful whole.
	- Focus not on adding more, but ways to remove constraints or obstacles. But before this we need to know the essential intent.
	- Avoid big hyped up projects that never got anywhere.
- Saying no
	- A clear no can be more graceful than a noncommital yes.
	- Let me check my calendar and get back to you.
	- Yes, what should I deprioritise.
	- Slow yes, quick no.
	- Enabling others to solve problems.
- In the immediate
	- What did you do as a child, could you reintroduce?
	- Review and eliminate your non-essential activities. Scale back activities and assess if there's any meaningful impact.
