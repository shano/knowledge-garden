	- Less but better
	- Get the right things gone
	- Stop saying yes and make your highest contribution towards things that really matter.
	- Make execution effortless
	- Live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me

- Planning your day
	- Spend 20 minutes reading something timeless.
	- Invest in space to reflect
	- Stop attending meetings you can't contribute to or can't get anything from

		- I choose to
		- Only a few things matter
		- I can do anything not everything
		- What do I want to go big on?
	- What problem do I want?
	- Schedule blank space to think.
	- Don't fill your day!
- During the day
	- Ask yourself frequently "Is this the most important thing I could be doing right now?'
	- Keep a "less but better" journal
	- If the answer isn't a definite yes, it's a no. What's the most important criterion for the decision, if it's less than 90% reject it.
	- Don't do because others ask.
