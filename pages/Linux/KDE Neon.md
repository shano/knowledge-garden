## Philosophy
- Reached out to their users and opted for a non [[snap]] variant of firefox, sounds like a distro I should try.

## Bugs
- [[Kmail]] is mega unreliable, blew far too much time trying to get it working with [[Fastmail]]. At least I gained a bunch of useless knowledge about [[Akonadis]] which I'd never heard of before.
- Not as reliable/brainless during upgrades. My own fault, but not something I want to have to do with my distro. https://old.reddit.com/r/kdeneon/comments/ycpmg6/fyi_be_careful_when_upgrading_to_kde_neon_with/
- Running into [[kwin]] bugs when I dual-screen it.
