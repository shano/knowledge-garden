Reclining Bound Angle is another great nighttime yoga pose.

Anything can be used as a prop, such as a blanket, towel, bolster, even a simple pile of (your favorite yoga) books can do the trick.

It is thought that this response helps to reduce the heart rate and encourage a peaceful night’s sleep.

In the aforementioned [Relax and Renew: Restful Yoga for Stressful Times book](https://geni.us/H6JD), Judith Hanson Lasater describes how the pose is powerful at reducing fatigue, especially if you are struggling with [insomnia](https://www.thegoodbody.com/insomnia-facts/).

It also has benefits for women during menstruation.

There are [a number of variations to the Child’s Pose](https://www.tummee.com/yoga-poses/child-pose/variations), including the wide-knee version.

The goal is to be rested, so yogis suggest that anything that makes the pose more comfortable should be encouraged, such as placing a cushion or pad under your head so it’s not resting on the floor.

In his book [A Journey into Yin Yoga](https://geni.us/eyB9e), renowned practitioner Travis Eliot describes the power of yoga for sleep.

Focussing on the Child’s Pose in particular, he comments how this pose “activates the nervous system’s relaxation response”.

He does however advise caution if you’re suffering from tight hips or a knee injury.

Happy Baby is a peaceful bedtime pose that is easy for beginners to master, so ideal if you’re just discovering [the benefits of yoga](https://www.thegoodbody.com/yoga-benefits/) and are hoping for better sleep.

Straps are suggested initially if you struggle to reach your ankles, so make the pose as comfortable for yourself as possible.

Mimicking a happy baby, yogis can hold their feet or ankles to create a pose that offers full body relaxation.

[Its stress relieving qualities](https://www.yogapedia.com/definition/6413/ananda-balasana) make the pose ideal for practicing before bed to encourage a good night’s sleep. However the pose should not be practiced by pregnant women.

Any yoga practice is always finished with the Savasana. This pose is designed to close the body and create a relaxation response perfect for just before you climb in to bed.

It is also shown to reduce your blood pressure. Use Yoga Nidra to enter yogic sleep and feel even more rested as you practice the pose.

The simplicity of the pose means it can be practiced in bed, as long as you remove any bulky quilts or blankets so you’re lying on the flattest possible surface.
