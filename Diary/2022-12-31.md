* [[Parenting]] - When desperate can get a terrible night sleep with a sick child attached to you in a rocking chair
* Some fun new years surprises when my laptop would not decrypt my boot disk/grub.
	* [[KDE Neon]] is not as reliable as I'd like(or as brainless as I'd like perhaps). Upgrade process(which I probably chose defaults for everything) has broken disk encryption.
	* Looks like my main luks disk isn't accepting my password but my swap is,,,
	* [[cryptomount]] is available during grub
	* [[AntiX]] is a solid little bootable recovery distro
		* Don't do any searching from your bootable disto you might lose the awesome guide I found that showed a bunch of ways to interact with luks when your son pulls out the usb key....
